When we run the program it talks to the computerâ€™s operating system using system calls. 
"Listing processes" uses calls like opendir, readdir, and closedir to look inside the /proc folder. 
Reading process info uses open, read, and close to get data from files about each process.  
Showing system info with library functions like "fopen" and "fgets" makes fewer calls because the 
computer reads bigger chunks at once. System calls make more calls comapred to libary calls which is faster and easier
